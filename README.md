=====

This is *balde*, a microframework for C based on GLib and bad intentions.

It is designed to be fast, simple, and memory efficient. Most of its architecture is based on other microframeworks, like Flask, and it can run on any web server that supports FastCGI.

*balde* is free software, released under the LGPL2 license.


But what about the name?!
-------------------------

"balde" means "bucket" in Portuguese.
