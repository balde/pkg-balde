==============

balde is a micro-framework, it just does the basic and tries to do it quite well. As a micro-framework, it will not stay on your way, and will let you do almost anything that you may want, but you may have to do some extra work to get complex stuff done.

balde is heavily based on GLib, the low-level system libraries developed by GNOME project. Some knowledge of the library and its usege is required.

Some knowledge of other micro-frameworks, like [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) should be useful as well. balde has most of its architecture based on Flask, but changed to fit the requirements and limitations of the C programming language.
